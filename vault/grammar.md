#### word order
reta Kanubi uses a default word order of subject-verb-object, but because of case-suffixes, the word order is not strict and can be modified for emphasis or effect

#### proper adjectives 
instead of proper nouns, ret Kanubi uses a proper adjective system, with names modifying the nouns they represent

#### word case suffixes
because reta Kanubi uses content words that can be used in multiple contexts as nouns, verbs, or adjectives, it has suffixes that denote the case of the word.   
suffixes for for nominative and accusative and verb and prepositional phrase  
if the word already ends with that sound then it is replaced with the second sound. for example, kisa in the nominative case becomes kisao
two vowels next to each other get shortened to a diphthong. if that diphthong is illegal, they are seperated by a glottal stop. for example, kisa in the accusative case becomes kisawev
